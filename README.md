# MeetingManager
A tool to help people manage online meetings, allowing users to maintain a more sophistated waiting room
that tracks the order of people waiting to meet in a queue.
As a host you can control the queue by both dequeuing and clearing the queue. Your users will be able to see the
queue status and their queue position.
They will also be able to see how many people are waiting in the queue and how long they have been waiting for.
